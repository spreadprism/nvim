hello

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, managed with [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [nixCats-nvim](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim). It provides a highly customized and modular development environment with extensive language support, UI enhancements, and various developer tools.
